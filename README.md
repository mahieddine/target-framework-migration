Target Framework Migration Macro
Change the Target Framework for all your .net projects (Visual Studio 2012)

To use this macro you have to follow this steps :

1 – Open your solution under VS 2010 (Yes you need visual studio 2010 just to execute the Macro)

2 – Run the Macro

3 – Put in the prompt Fx45 (in my case it was .net4.5 but you can and should of course specify the version you use)

4 – Then open your solution again under vs 2012 (and Checkin eventually in your source control system)

That’s it
